- **Archive Process**: Old AWS documentation properly archived

## Current Status

### Staging Deployment
- **Configuration**: Ready for deployment with `fly.staging.toml`
- **Prerequisites**: Fly.io billing setup required (blocked by payment info)
- **Testing**: E2E test suite ready to run against staging environment

### Production Readiness
- **Configuration**: Complete with `fly.toml`
- **Secrets**: All environment variables documented and ready
- **Monitoring**: Health checks configured for `/api/health` and `/api/ready`
- **Backup**: B2 integration ready with verification scripts

### Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: Partially passing (some dependency issues in Jest ESM config)
- **E2E Tests**: Comprehensive Cypress suite configured and ready
- **Backup Tests**: Script created and ready for execution with proper credentials
- **Performance**: Load testing framework configured

## Next Steps (Post-Merge)

### Immediate Actions
1. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment once PR is merged
2. **E2E Validation**: Run full end-to-end test suite against staging
3. **Backup Verification**: Execute B2 backup integrity tests
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate response times and scalability

### Production Deployment
1. **Secrets Configuration**: Set all required environment variables in Fly.io
2. **DNS Configuration**: Prepare for domain cutover
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production after staging validation
4. **Performance Monitoring**: 24-hour monitoring period

## Key Deliverables

### Files Created
- `FLY_IO_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive migration plan
- `QUICKSTART_FLY.md` - Quick deployment guide
- `POST_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md` - Verification procedures
- `AWS_DOCUMENTATION_ARCHIVE.md` - AWS infrastructure archive
- `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` - Pull request documentation
- `fly.toml` & `fly.staging.toml` - Deployment configurations
- `scripts/test-b2-backup.sh` - Backup verification script
- `docs/SECRETS_FLY.md` - Secrets management guide

### Tests Created

- **Secrets Management**: Need to configure production secrets

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive rollback procedures documented
- Staging environment for validation
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated backup verification

## Success Metrics

### Completed
- ✅ All required documentation created
- ✅ Migration plan comprehensive and executable
- ✅ PR created with proper references
