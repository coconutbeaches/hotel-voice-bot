## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
1. **Fly.io Account**: Set up with billing information
2. **Backblaze B2**: Configure backup storage account
3. **Secrets Configuration**: Set all required environment variables
4. **DNS Configuration**: Prepare for cutover

### Deployment Order
1. Deploy staging environment first
2. Run comprehensive E2E tests on staging
3. Verify B2 backup integration
4. Deploy production environment
5. DNS cutover and traffic routing
6. Monitor and validate performance

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Core Application
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Database
DATABASE_URL={{DATABASE_URL}}
SUPABASE_URL={{SUPABASE_URL}}
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY={{SUPABASE_ANON_KEY}}

```

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level: Medium

### Key Risks & Mitigations
1. **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backup verification before cutover
2. **Service Downtime**: Blue-green deployment with immediate rollback capability
3. **Performance Issues**: Staging environment testing and performance benchmarking
4. **Integration Failures**: Comprehensive E2E testing covers all integrations

### Rollback Plan
- **Immediate Rollback** (< 1 hour): Revert DNS to AWS infrastructure
- **Full Rollback** (< 4 hours): Complete AWS infrastructure restoration
- **Emergency Contacts**: Migration team on standby during deployment

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements
- **Cost Reduction**: 40% reduction compared to AWS
- **Latency**: < 100ms from Bangkok (Singapore region)
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling 0-3 machines based on demand
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime target with health checks

### Monitoring Setup
- Application performance monitoring
- Database connection pooling
- Resource utilization alerts
- Error rate monitoring

## Documentation Changes

### New Documentation
- `FLY_IO_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Complete migration plan and checklist
- `QUICKSTART_FLY.md` - Quick deployment guide
- `POST_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md` - Verification procedures
- `docs/SECRETS_FLY.md` - Secrets management guide

### Updated Documentation
- `README.md` - Updated with Fly.io deployment instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment procedures
- Test configurations and setup guides

## Breaking Changes

### Infrastructure Changes
